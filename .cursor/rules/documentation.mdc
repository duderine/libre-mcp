# Documentation Rules

## Language & Format
- Write all documentation in English (code, comments, descriptions)
- Use Markdown format (.md files)
- Place all documentation files in the `docs/` folder

## Content Guidelines
- Maximize information density: include essential facts, omit filler
- Document important information concisely without unnecessary verbosity
- Focus on actionable, technical details over narrative explanations
- Include code examples, configuration snippets, and command-line instructions where relevant

## File Management
- When creating new .md files, always update `docs/README.md` to include references/links
- Maintain `docs/README.md` as the entry point and index for all documentation
- Use descriptive filenames that clearly indicate content scope

## Structure Standards
- Use clear hierarchical headings (H1 for main title, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections)
- Include table of contents for documents longer than 3 sections
- Add code blocks with appropriate language tags for syntax highlighting
- Use lists for enumerations, requirements, or step-by-step instructions
